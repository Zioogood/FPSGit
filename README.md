# Project SimpleShooter

This is a project based on a completed Udemy course. The presented game is created in C ++, we have here the addition of AI mechanics, the behavior tree, in the project, the opponents, after seeing the hero, move towards it and attack it within a certain period of time, when the hero disappears from their sight, they return to their initial position. From the classes in C ++ I created a children class in blueprint, thanks to which I better recorded the animations in blendspace and passed information to the aim graph, which resulted in a smoother and in my opinion better and more controlled animation of movement or death. The project is still under development.
