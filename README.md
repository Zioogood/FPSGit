# Project MarsMarine

This is a blueprint project that was created along with the Udemy course.
The aim of the project is to show mechanics that I know, such as desing level, spawn point control or AI behavior.
In the presented project, I focused mainly on gameplay mechanics.
Simple game in which waves of opponents appear successively and our task is to defeat them and move to the next level.
